Program Description: This program is designed to make applying for jobs/co-ops easier by finetuning your resume for a given job description. The user adds all their work experience and education info to the database, regardless of if it is relevant to a specific job posting they are applying for. They then paste a job description into the resume generator page. The job description is submitted to the OpenAI chat completions API, along with all their work and education experience. The language model decides what is relevant and incorporates the key words and requirements from the job description. It then returns the resume to the user in markdown format.
